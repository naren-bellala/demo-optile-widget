## Explanation

all the needed op-payment-widget-v3 files will be copied to the source code of the project src to be able to get the styling correctly to selective native.

html, css and js should be in the same directory together.

Note: selective native styling moved to the iframe will only work with https serve.

To run https locally, you eed to generate cert.pem and key.pem using openssl `openssl req -newkey rsa:2048 -new -nodes -x509 -days 3650 -keyout key.pem -out cert.pem` check openssl : https://github.com/openssl/openssl

thank you can run

`npm run startssl`

in place of

`npm start`
